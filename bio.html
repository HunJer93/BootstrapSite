				Hunter Moss was born and raised in Anderson, South Carolina. At the age of 12, Moss became interested in music and started learning how to play the guitar. After a few years, Hunter began his music career playing dive bars in Anderson and Greenville with his Dad driving him and supervising him at shows. Once graduated from high school, Moss did some soul searching before he decided to go to school for music. When the decision was made, he hopped on a plane to California and attended the Musician’s Institute in Hollywood. At the Musician’s Institute, Moss studied under great guitar players like Chas Grasamke, Ed Finn, Dale Turner, Dave Hill, and Dan Gilbert for guitar performance. Not only did he grow as a guitarist, but Moss also studied songwritting under John Keller at the Musician's Institue; some of those songs even making his recent album, "Baseborn Troubadour".

				Once he graduated the Musician's Institute at the age of 20, Moss returned to his hometown and developed aspirations for a music career. Having once had the taste of the city life, Moss was no longer content in his rural town, and in 2010, Moss relocated to Charleston, SC. Around that time, he helped found “The Charleston Wedding Band” (also known as Dan’s Tramp Stamp and the Money Bags), and made a good career as a wedding musician. Several years later, Moss grew tired of the wedding scene, and in 2013, he left the group to start his first project “Pluff Mud Queen” with Stefan Williams and Cameron Ballinger of “Dan’s Tramp Stamp and the Money Bags”.
